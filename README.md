Build Difference Analyzer
=====================

This is a Jenkins plugin to display the difference between two builds.

This plugin lets users select two builds in a Jenkins project and view information about the

differences between the two builds. The information this plugin lets users view includes unit test

coverage statistics, file changes (including side-by-side file diffs), and a variety of information

about automated test results. This plugin is highly useful for a team that is practicing Extreme

Programming and wants to evaluate their progress.
